Zen of Python!!!
1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2.Explicit is better than implicit.
3.Simple is better than complex.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
9.Although practicality beats purity.
12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
